# Vibe Insights AI - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and features for the Vibe Insights AI CLI tool. It's intended to guide both maintainers and community contributors toward building a more robust and feature-rich tool.

## Current Status

The CLI has a solid foundation with these key capabilities:
- Repository analysis (local and GitHub-connected)
- Documentation generation with OpenAI integration
- Code complexity analysis
- Dependency visualization
- Semantic code search
- Tech stack detection

## Short-term Goals (1-3 months)

### Code Quality & Testing
- [ ] Improve test coverage to at least 80%
- [ ] Add integration tests for main functionality
- [ ] Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

### Documentation 
- [ ] Complete JSDoc documentation for all functions
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive error handling across all modules
- [ ] Create example videos and tutorials
- [ ] Add detailed API reference docs

### Features
- [ ] Support for more programming languages in complexity analysis
- [ ] Improve dependency visualization with interactive graphs
- [ ] Add export to PDF functionality for generated documentation
- [ ] Implement caching for faster repeat analysis

## Medium-term Goals (3-6 months)

### API & Integration
- [ ] Create REST API for programmatic access
- [ ] Build integrations with popular CI/CD platforms
- [ ] Add GitLab and Bitbucket OAuth support
- [ ] Create documented plugin system for community extensions

### Features
- [ ] Implement change analysis between repository versions
- [ ] Add security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Support team collaboration features
- [ ] Create desktop GUI application wrapper

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize large repository handling
- [ ] Implement concurrent processing for faster analysis
- [ ] Add incremental analysis to avoid reprocessing unchanged files

## Long-term Goals (6+ months)

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Add role-based access control for teams
- [ ] Implement custom organization-specific documentation templates
- [ ] Add support for private LLM deployments
- [ ] Create enterprise dashboard for repository analytics

### AI & ML Improvements
- [ ] Train custom models for code analysis
- [ ] Implement advanced code quality metrics
- [ ] Add automatic refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Provide predictive analysis for code maintainability

### Community & Ecosystem
- [ ] Create community plugin marketplace
- [ ] Launch developer certification program
- [ ] Build documentation sharing platform
- [ ] Support integration with popular IDEs

## Plugin System (Planned)

The CLI will support a plugin system to allow community developers to extend functionality. The plugin API is currently in development and will include:

- Standard interfaces for custom analyzers
- Hooks into the documentation generation process
- Support for custom output formats
- Extension points for repository providers beyond GitHub

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how to get involved:

1. Pick an item from the roadmap that interests you
2. Open an issue to discuss your approach
3. Fork the repository and implement your changes
4. Submit a pull request with your implementation
5. Ensure tests pass and documentation is updated

For more details, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Version Planning

- **v1.1.x**: Focus on improving test coverage and documentation
- **v1.2.x**: Enhance existing analyzers and support more languages
- **v1.3.x**: Implement plugin system and API access
- **v2.0.0**: Major update with desktop application and team features

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves and based on community feedback.
